## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.3 or higher
- Node.js 20 or higher
- Composer
- Docker (optional but recommended)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spendly.git
   cd spendly
   ```

3. **Set up the environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Using Docker (Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   docker compose exec cli composer install
   docker compose exec cli php artisan key:generate
   docker compose exec cli php artisan migrate --seed
   docker compose exec node npm install
   docker compose exec node npm run dev
   ```

5. **Or install locally**:
   ```bash
   composer install
   php artisan key:generate
   php artisan migrate --seed
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

See [Development.md](docs/Development.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Making Changes

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Development branch for integration
- Feature branches: `feature/feature-name`
- Bug fixes: `fix/bug-description`
- Documentation: `docs/topic-name`

### Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch** from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our style guidelines

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly:
   ```bash
   # Run PHP tests
   ./vendor/bin/phpunit
   
   # Run frontend tests
   npm test
   
   # Check code style
   vendor/bin/pint
   npm run lint
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** with a clear message:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add transaction categorization feature"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Requests

1. **Create a Pull Request** against the `develop` branch
2. **Fill out the PR template** completely
3. **Ensure all checks pass** (tests, linting, etc.)
4. **Request review** from maintainers
5. **Address feedback** promptly

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused and atomic
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Add changelog entry for user-facing changes
- Reference any related issues
