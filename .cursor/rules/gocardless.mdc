# GoCardless

- Prefer delegating to the `gocardless` subagent for Bank Data integration work.
- Full docs: docs/ai/GoCardless_Architecture.md.
- Controllers: GoCardlessController (routes under settings/bank). BankDataController for settings UI.
- Use BankDataClientInterface; production vs mock via client factories (GoCardlessClientFactoryInterface, ProductionClientFactory, MockClientFactory).
- Token/requisition flow: TokenManager, requisition creation and callback handling. Do not hardcode secrets.
